"Unconditional Positive Regard", made in Natalie Lawhead's Electric Zine Maker, aimed to pick up where my earlier work "Pathways, Desire Lines" left off, and presents an introduction to Carl Rogers' concept of unconditional positive regard, a state of complete non-judgmental acceptance. The concept was originally described as a quality present between client and therapist; I argue that it can be found in various everyday life experiences, and that much introductory writing on it does not do justice to its full complexity.
