I was commissioned by [Darius Kazemi](https://tinysubversions.com) to design and develop the markup and stylesheet for his article ['Run Your Own Social: How to run a small social network site for your friends'](https://runyourown.social). We created a single-page website with no external files or embedded fonts, to maximise speed, readability and usability. The final design was inspired by the classic interface for MacOS.

(As of April 2022, I am available for occasional hire as a designer and/or developer; if you are interested in working together, please do get in touch.)
