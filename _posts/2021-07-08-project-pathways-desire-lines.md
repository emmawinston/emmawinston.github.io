"Pathways, Desire Lines" represented an attempt to condense some of the core findings and literature of my doctoral thesis into a minimalist and accessible multimedia form, which was presented as an "interactive poster" at the CHASE DTP Encounters conference in 2021. 

The project has limitations; it leaves out the conceptual lens of unconditional positive regard, drawn from Carl Rogers' work, which was a core part of the theoretical framework of my project. Communicating this clearly and concisely was ultimately beyond what I was able to achieve in this form, but I am considering the possibilities for expanding the game further in the future.
